# Product decisions

## Separate sibling product

Pomade is a standalone repository. GTM Control Tower and Scoutbound remain
independently runnable; Pomade integrates through explicit adapters instead of
copying either codebase. This keeps the grid product free to evolve without
regressing existing portfolio work.

## Glide supplies the grid, not the product

Glide Data Grid owns virtualization, navigation, selection, editing, and
copy/paste. Pomade owns workspace structure, recipe columns, execution,
persistence, receipts, and integrations. Pomade uses Glide as an MIT-licensed
dependency and does not copy Bitscale or Clay source code.

## Hosted and self-hosted execution boundaries

The hosted batch runner supports safe deterministic recipes and records zero
external writes. A selected-row Apollo action may read a business profile after
an explicit credit confirmation; exact name and company-domain checks decide
whether a verified work email can be accepted. Scoutbound's richer HTTP,
waterfall, AI, script, and command execution belongs behind a self-hosted worker
adapter. Future CRM mutation must go through GTM Control Tower's preview,
approval, receipt, and rollback boundary.

## Apollo email before phone reveal

The first provider slice uses Apollo's synchronous People Enrichment response
for business profile and verified work email data. Personal-email and phone
flags are explicitly false. Phone reveal remains separate because it can add
eight credits and requires Apollo to call a publicly reachable HTTPS webhook;
the current owner-only Site cannot safely receive that callback.

Provider results are cached in D1 for 30 days behind a hashed identity/domain
key. Cache hits report zero new credits. Mismatched identities never expose the
returned person's fields, and uncertain emails stay in review state.
